JavaScript Engine and Runtime

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language, but in modern environments, it runs through powerful JavaScript engines and runtimes.

JavaScript Engine

A JavaScript engine is a program that executes JavaScript code. It takes the code, compiles it to machine code (not interprets line-by-line like older engines), and runs it efficiently. The most popular engines include:

V8 (used in Chrome and Node.js)

SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox)

JavaScriptCore (used in Safari)


How it works:

1. Parsing: The engine reads JavaScript code and parses it into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).


2. Compilation: The AST is compiled into machine code by the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.


3. Execution: The machine code is executed directly by the CPU.



This process helps JavaScript run faster, especially in browsers.

JavaScript Runtime

While the engine executes the code, the runtime environment provides the tools and APIs to interact with the outside world (e.g., browser or server). A runtime includes:

JavaScript Engine (like V8)

Web APIs (like setTimeout, fetch, DOM APIs in browsers)

Callback queue

Event loop


The event loop is a crucial part. It manages asynchronous operations by picking tasks from the callback queue and pushing them to the call stack when it’s empty.

Browser vs Node.js Runtime

Browser Runtime includes DOM APIs, fetch, alert, etc.

Node.js Runtime includes file system access, HTTP module, etc.


The JavaScript engine alone can’t handle asynchronous tasks or interact with files/network. The runtime bridges this gap.
