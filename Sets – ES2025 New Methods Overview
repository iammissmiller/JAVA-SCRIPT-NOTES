JavaScript Sets â€“ ES2025 New Methods Overview

Prior to ES2025

Sets had only four methods:

has()

add()

delete()

clear()

Due to limited functionality, sets were rarely used in real-world applications.

ES2025 Update: 7 New Set Methods

Makes Sets more useful and powerful, especially when used with arrays.

Aligns JavaScript Sets more closely with sets in other programming languages.

Demo Data Used

Two sets representing food ingredients:

const italianFoods = new Set(['pasta', 'gnocchi', 'tomatoes', 'olive oil', 'garlic', 'basil']);
const mexicanFoods = new Set(['tortilla', 'queso', 'tomatoes', 'beans', 'garlic', 'avocado']);

New Set Methods

1. intersection(set)

Returns a new Set containing elements present in both sets.

const commonFoods = italianFoods.intersection(mexicanFoods);
Result: Set { 'tomatoes', 'garlic' }

Convert to array if needed:

const commonArray = [...commonFoods];

2. union(set)

Returns a new Set with all unique elements from both sets.

const fusion = italianFoods.union(mexicanFoods);
Alternate way using arrays:

const fusionArray = [...new Set([...italianFoods, ...mexicanFoods])];

3. difference(set)

Returns a Set of elements in the first set but not in the second.

Order matters.

Italian-specific ingredients:

const uniqueItalianFoods = italianFoods.difference(mexicanFoods);
Mexican-specific ingredients:

const uniqueMexicanFoods = mexicanFoods.difference(italianFoods);

4. symmetricDifference(set)

Returns elements in either set but not in both.

Excludes common elements.

const uniqueItalianAndMexicanFoods = italianFoods.symmetricDifference(mexicanFoods);

5. isDisjointFrom(set)

Returns true if the two sets share no elements; otherwise, false.

console.log(italianFoods.isDisjointFrom(mexicanFoods)); // false

6. isSubsetOf(set)

Returns true if all elements of the current set are in the other set.

7. isSupersetOf(set)

Returns true if the current set contains all elements of the other set.

Set Theory Reference

These methods are equivalent to standard set operations in mathematics:

Intersection

Union

Difference

Symmetric Difference

Disjoint Sets

Browser Compatibility

These methods are new in ES2025.

Supported only in the latest versions of modern browsers.
