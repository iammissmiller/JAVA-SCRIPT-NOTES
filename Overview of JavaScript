#Overview of Javascript

Java script is a high level programming language 

Interpreted or just in time compiled

Its Multi Paradigm

Paradigms : An approach and mindset of Structuring code, which will direct your coding style and technique.

Three types of Paradigm.

Procedural Programming

Object oriented programming (OOP)

Functional programming (FP)

JS does all of it.

Prototype - based object Oriented.

First-clans Functions 

In a language with first-class functions, function are simply treated as variable. we can pass them into other functions, and return them from function.

Dynamically-typed language

JS is a dynamic languge.

#Concurrency model : how the Java Script engine handles multiple tasks happening at the same time

why do we need that

# Java Script runs in one single thread so it can only do one thing at a time.

So what about a long running task ?

sounds life it would block the single theread, However, we want non blocking behaviour!

How to we achieve that ?

By using an event loop: takes Long running tasks, enccuses them on the background and puts then back in the main thread once they are finished
