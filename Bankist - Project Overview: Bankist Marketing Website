Bankist - Project Overview: Bankist Marketing Website

### **Purpose**

* Build a **marketing website** for the fictional **Bankist** bank (previously we built its banking app).
* The **HTML** and **CSS** are provided in starter files.
* You will use **JavaScript** to add all interactive and dynamic effects.

---

## **Key Features (All Built Using JavaScript)**

1. **Modal (Popup) Window**

   * Opens when clicking “Open Account” or similar buttons.
   * Closes when clicking the overlay, close button, or pressing Escape.
   * Prevents the page from jumping to the top when opened (using `event.preventDefault()`).

2. **Smooth Scrolling**

   * Clicking on navigation links or “Learn more” buttons smoothly scrolls to sections on the same page.

3. **Sticky Navigation Bar**

   * The navigation bar sticks to the top of the viewport once the user scrolls past the header section.

4. **Section Reveal on Scroll (Fade-in Effect)**

   * Each section initially hidden.
   * Gradually fades and slides in when scrolled into view.

5. **Lazy Loading of Images**

   * Low-resolution (blurred) placeholders load first.
   * As the user scrolls, full-resolution images are loaded only when needed — improving performance.

6. **Tabbed Component**

   * A common UI pattern: clicking on a tab (e.g., “Operations”, “Features”, “About”) shows related content.
   * Implemented by toggling CSS classes and handling click events.

7. **Menu Hover Animation**

   * When hovering over one nav link, the others fade out slightly for a focus effect.

8. **Image Slider / Carousel**

   * Multiple slides (usually 3).
   * Move between slides using:

     * Left/Right arrow buttons
     * Keyboard arrow keys
     * Small clickable navigation dots below the slider
   * Slides loop continuously.

## **Starter Files Provided**

1. **index.html**

   * Contains all page structure.
   * You’ll connect JavaScript through `<script src="script.js"></script>` at the bottom.

2. **style.css**

   * Prewritten CSS for the entire site (hundreds of lines).
   * Already styled — no changes required for now.

3. **script.js**

   * Already contains the **modal window code** from previous lessons.
   * You’ll add new JS functionality step-by-step.

---

## **Initial Improvements to Existing Modal Code**

1. **Prevent Default Link Behavior**

   * Some buttons are `<a href="#">` links.
   * Default behavior makes the page jump to the top.
   * Fix using:

     ```js
     btnOpenModal.addEventListener('click', function (e) {
       e.preventDefault(); // Stops the jump
       openModal();
     });
     ```

2. **Use forEach() Instead of for Loop**

   * Cleaner way to attach event listeners to multiple buttons.
   * Replace:

     ```js
     for (let i = 0; i < btnsOpenModal.length; i++)
       btnsOpenModal[i].addEventListener('click', openModal);
     ```

     with:

     ```js
     btnsOpenModal.forEach(btn => btn.addEventListener('click', openModal));
     ```

## **Outcome**

* The modal popup now works smoothly.
* Page no longer jumps on click.
* Code is modernized using `forEach()`.
* Project is set up and ready for further JavaScript DOM manipulation features.
