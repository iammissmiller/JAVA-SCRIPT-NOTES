Here Array is not like C we can have different datatype in a single array .

It is changing a variable declared with const. # Contracdiction?

That const can't be changed rule only. applies only on primitive values.

Array is not a primitive value its a user defined data structure. so, we can manipulate it.

But we can not replace an entrie array that would be illegal.
