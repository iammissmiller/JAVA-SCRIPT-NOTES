**Project Planning – Mapty App**

## **1. Why Planning Is Important**

* Jumping straight into coding causes **confusion, rework, and messy code**.
* Planning helps:

  * Clarify **features**
  * Define **structure (architecture)**
  * Avoid **spaghetti code**
* Real-world development **always begins with a planning phase**.

---

## **2. The Four Planning Steps**

1. **User Stories** → Define functionality from the user’s perspective.
2. **Features** → Translate user stories into app features.
3. **Flowchart** → Visualize interactions, events, and data flow.
4. **Architecture** → Decide how to organize and implement the code.

---

## **3. Step 1 – User Stories**

**Definition:**

> A user story describes the app’s functionality from the **user’s point of view** — answering *who*, *what*, and *why.*

**Format:**

> “As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that I can [get a benefit].”

### **User Stories for Mapty App**

1. **Running Log:**

   * As a user, I want to log running workouts with location, distance, time, pace, and cadence (steps/minute) so that I can track my running history.
2. **Cycling Log:**

   * As a user, I want to log cycling workouts with location, distance, time, speed, and elevation gain so that I can track my cycling sessions.
3. **Workout Summary:**

   * As a user, I want to see all my workouts at a glance so that I can monitor progress over time.
4. **Map Display:**

   * As a user, I want to view my workouts on a map so that I can visualize where I train the most.
5. **Data Persistence:**

   * As a user, I want my workouts to remain saved when I leave and return to the app so that I can continue using it later.

## **4. Step 2 – Deriving Features**

Each **user story → corresponding features**.

| **User Story**      | **Planned Features**                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Log running/cycling | • Click on map to add workout<br>• Form to input details (distance, time, cadence/elevation)<br>• Geolocation to display current position |
| See all workouts    | • Workout list displaying details                                                                                                         |
| View on map         | • Display workouts as markers on map                                                                                                      |
| Persistent data     | • Store data in **Local Storage**<br>• Load and render data when page reloads                                                             |
| Extra feature       | • Click workout in list → move map to workout location                                                                                    |

## **5. Step 3 – Flowchart Design**

**Purpose:** Visualize how features, user actions, and data connect.

### **Key Events & Flow**

1. **Page Load**

   * Get user’s current location (via **Geolocation API**) → Render map centered on current position.
   * Fetch workouts from **Local Storage** → Render on map & list.
2. **User Clicks Map**

   * Render input **form** for new workout.
3. **Form Submission**

   * Create new workout object (running/cycling).
   * Render workout on map and list.
   * Save all workouts to **Local Storage**.
4. **User Clicks Workout in List**

   * Move map to workout location.

**Flowchart Elements:**

* **Yellow boxes:** Actions (e.g., form display, event handling)
* **Green boxes:** UI rendering steps
* **Red boxes:** Asynchronous operations (e.g., geolocation, fetching storage data)

## **6. Step 4 – Application Architecture**

**Definition:**

> Architecture defines *how* code is structured and organized.

**Purpose:**

* Decide how features will be implemented and connected.
* Prevent “spaghetti code” by defining clear code organization.

### **Typical Architectural Decisions**

* Use of **classes** to structure logic (e.g., `Workout`, `Running`, `Cycling`, `App`).
* Organize code into:

  * **Data layer** (handling workouts and storage)
  * **UI layer** (rendering map, form, and list)
  * **Control flow** (event listeners and user interaction)
* JavaScript features: **Classes**, **Modules**, **Event Handlers**, **Local Storage API**, **Asynchronous operations**.

**Note:**
You don’t need the *perfect* architecture at the start — it can evolve during coding as you understand what the app needs.

## **7. Summary – The Mapty Planning Process**

| **Step**     | **Goal**                             | **Output**                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| User Stories | Define what users want               | Sentences describing features |
| Features     | Identify necessary app functionality | List of app features          |
| Flowchart    | Plan user interaction & data flow    | Visual event sequence         |
| Architecture | Plan code structure                  | Organized code blueprint      |

## **8. Core Takeaways**

* Always **plan before coding**.
* Use **user stories** to think from the user’s view.
* Translate stories → **features** → **flowchart** → **architecture**.
* Don’t aim for perfection — **planning clarity matters more than complexity**.
* Proper planning = **faster, cleaner, maintainable code**.
